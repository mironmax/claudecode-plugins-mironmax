## Installation

### 1. Add This Marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add mironmax/claudecode-plugins
```

### 2. Install Plugins

```
/plugin install knowledge-graph@maxim-plugins
```

### 3. Enable Auto-Loading (Important!)

Add the knowledge graph instructions to your Claude configuration:

```bash
# If you don't have ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md yet:
cp ~/.claude/plugins/knowledge-graph/templates/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# If you already have ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md:
# Manually append the content from ~/.claude/plugins/knowledge-graph/templates/CLAUDE.md
# to your existing file
```

**Why this matters:** The template contains instructions that tell Claude to automatically load the knowledge graph at session start and register for sync tracking. Without it, you'll need to manually call tools each session.

### 4. Restart Claude Code

The plugin will be available after restart.
