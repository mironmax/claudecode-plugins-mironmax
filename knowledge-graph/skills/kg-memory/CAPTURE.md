# Capturing Knowledge

## The Art of Node Placement

A knowledge graph's power comes from compression through reuse. When you write `I → likes → pizza` and `Bob → likes → pizza`, the concept `pizza` exists once and is referenced twice. Every additional reference to `pizza` is essentially free — the node has already paid its token cost. This is why node placement matters: place nodes at concepts that will be referenced from multiple contexts.

Think of it like vocabulary. A word becomes useful when it appears in many sentences. A node becomes powerful when it participates in many edges.

### Capture immediately

Capture knowledge **when you discover it**, not at session end. The insight that took 20 minutes to discover takes 20 seconds to record — but only while the context is fresh.

### Should I capture this?

Three questions, in order:
1. **Recoverable from artifacts?** (code, docs, config) → Don't capture
2. **Required non-trivial effort to discover?** → If no, probably skip
3. **Would this help future sessions?** → If yes, capture it

### Capture triggers

| Trigger | What to capture | Level |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| 10+ min debugging | Root cause pattern, not just the fix | project |
| User corrected approach | Signal you missed, how to recognize it | user |
| Explaining same thing twice | The explanation as a reusable node | project |
| Undocumented dependency | The relationship as an edge | project |
| Architectural decision | Decision AND rationale | project |
| Pattern from another project | Generalized pattern | user |
| Got confused about something obvious | Why it's confusing | user |

## Compression Through Reuse

The graph's compression works like language. Consider this example:

**Without reuse** (3 separate nodes):
```
node: "api-auth-needs-session" — API auth requires active session
node: "websocket-auth-needs-session" — WebSocket auth requires active session
node: "cron-auth-needs-session" — Cron auth requires active session
```

**With reuse** (1 node + 3 edges):
```
node: "session-handler" — Session lifecycle manager, provides auth context
edge: api/auth.py --requires--> session-handler
edge: websocket/auth.py --requires--> session-handler
edge: cron/auth.py --requires--> session-handler
```

Same information, one-third the tokens, and `session-handler` is now a reusable concept. Future references cost zero.

## Choosing Node Granularity

A node should be **atomic** — one concept, one headline. If your gist uses "and" to join independent ideas, split into two nodes with an edge.

**Too broad:** "Config system loads env vars, validates them, and manages reload signals"
**Right granularity:** Three nodes — `config-loader`, `config-validator`, `config-reloader` — connected by edges.

**Too narrow:** Creating a node for every file or variable
**Right granularity:** Nodes for concepts, edges to specific files via `touches` or edge references.

The sweet spot: would you reference this concept from another context? If yes, it deserves a node.

## Edge-First Thinking

Before creating a node, ask: **"Can I express this as a relationship between existing things?"**

Edges encode meaning in structure. They connect to existing knowledge. They survive compaction better (connected nodes score higher).

**As a node:**
```
id: "api-auth-requires-session"
gist: "API auth system requires active session before validating tokens"
```

**Better as an edge:**
```
from: "api/auth.py" → to: "session-handler"
rel: "requires-active"
notes: ["token validation fails silently without session"]
```

Same information, but reuses existing references, makes the relationship explicit, and is discoverable from either end.

## Compression Techniques

### Remove filler
Bad: "I discovered that the configuration file needs to be loaded before the database module initializes"
Good: "config must load before db init; silent connection failure otherwise"

### Use references
Bad: "The user authentication module that handles login and token validation"
Good: `auth-module` (node ID)

### Encode as structure
Bad: Node "config-depends-on-env-vars" with gist explaining dependency
Good: Edge `config.py --reads--> .env` with notes for specifics

### Generalize after repetition
When you see the same pattern 3+ times:
Bad: Three nodes: "config-init-bug", "auth-init-bug", "cache-init-bug"
Good: One node: `silent-init-order-deps` — "modules with implicit init order fail silently; seen in config, auth, cache"

### The headline test
A gist should read like a newspaper headline — informative but terse.
Bad: "During debugging I found the API was returning 500 errors because..."
Good: "API 500s: db pool exhausted under concurrent auth checks"

## API Usage

### Creating a node
```
kg_put_node(
  level="project",           # or "user"
  id="kebab-case-id",        # descriptive, unique within level
  gist="the insight itself", # terse but complete (~15 words)
  touches=["file.py"],       # optional: related artifacts
  notes=["caveat or context"] # optional: additional details
)
```

**Then connect it** — an unconnected node shows a tip reminding you to add an edge.

### Creating an edge
```
kg_put_edge(
  level="project",
  from="source-node-or-path",
  to="target-node-or-path",
  rel="relationship-type",   # depends-on, requires, implements, contradicts, etc.
  notes=["optional context"]
)
```

Direct artifact references work without wrapping in nodes:
```
kg_put_edge(level="project", from="src/api/auth.py", to="src/session/handler.py",
            rel="requires-init", notes=["auth.validate() assumes session.current exists"])
```

## What to Capture at Each Level

### User Level (cross-project wisdom)
- Meta-cognitive patterns: "I tend to X when I should Y"
- Interaction signals: "When user says 'focus', I'm being too scattered"
- Architectural principles: "Agentic pipelines need explicit data contracts"
- Tool insights: "pytest fixtures > manual setup for stateful tests"
- Quality bar: Would this help in a completely different project?

### Project Level (codebase-specific)
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Non-obvious dependencies between components
- Debugging discoveries: "X fails when Y because Z"
- Code conventions not in docs
- Quality bar: Would a new developer benefit from knowing this?
